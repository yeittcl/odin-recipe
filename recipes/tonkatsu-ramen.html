    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you have ever wanted to make Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you. This everyday meal is great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. To save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <h3> Dish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 large egg</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
        <li> 2 boneless pork chop slices</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li> 2 leaves fresh basil</li>
        <li> 1 leaf fresh sage</li>
        <li> 1 package instant ramen noodle</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoon shredded dried kombu</li>
        <li> 1 3/4 tablespoon bonito soup stock</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 slices fish paste stick</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon sushi ginger</li>
        <li> 1 green onion</li>
        <li> 1 pinch ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li> Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
